## How to run your app with all the necessary details?
   
 1. Clone the repository on your computer.

To clone the repository, you can use the following command:

bash
git clone <'the URL of the repository you want to clone.'>
​


 2. Navigate to the project directory

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory using the following command:

bash
cd repository

Replace `repository` with the name of the repository you cloned.

 2. Run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies for your react app:

bash
npm install

3. Once the installation is complete, you can run your react app using the following command:

bash
npm start
​
This will start the development server and open your react app in your default web browser.


### How might you make this app more secure? How would you make this solution scale to millions of records?

I can ensure that my app is both secure and capable of handling a large volume of data effectively by implementing some security and scalability practices:

 To make the app more secure we can use:

 1. Authentication and Autorization.
   By implementing  robust authentication and authorization mechanisms using a secure authentication provider like Firebase Authentication we e nsure that only authorized users can access certain parts of the application.

 2. Secure storage.
    Instead of storing sensitive data like user credentials or API keys in plain text , we can use a secure storage solution system. These systems are designed to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.

3. Validate user input.
   We should validate user input to ensure that it meets the exprected format and constrains.This can help to prevent SQL injection, XSS attacks, and other security vulnerabilities.

4. Regular Security Audits and Updates:
   Conducting regular security audits of your application's codebase and dependencies. Keeps all software and libraries up to date with the latest security patches.

 To Scale millions of records we can use:

 1. Optimize our database:

   -  Select a database system that aligns with your application's requirements, considering factors such as data structure, volume, and query patterns.

   -  Optimize database queries to ensure they are efficient and performant. Utilize indexes, query optimization techniques, and analyze query execution plans to enhance performance.

   -  Design the database schema in an efficient manner, ensuring it supports the application's data access patterns and minimizes redundancy while maintaining data integrity.

2. Caching:

    -  Implement caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data in a cache. This reduces the need to query the main database for every request.

   -   Utilize in-memory caches like Redis to store data in RAM, allowing for lightning-fast access compared to disk-based storage.

    - Implement strategies for cache invalidation to ensure that the cached data remains accurate and up to date.

3. Integrate CDN :
    
    Integrate with CDNs to distribute and cache static assets (images, stylesheets, scripts) closer to end-users, resulting in faster load times and reduced strain on your server.

4. Optimize the Frontend
  
   -  We can write optimized frontend code by minimizing unnecessary renders, reducing redundant API calls, and utilizing efficient state management to enhance overall performance.

# Flex Business Solutions Tech Test - Notes app

In Flex Business Solutions, we aim to provide excellence and efficiency on all our lines of code in order to support the day-to-day activities of the company using our software solutions. In this task, you will be provided with a simple design of an app, fetching a list of products from an external source and allowing the user to search or filter among the list.


### Tech Test Overview
We have provided below the Figma link of this task. On the main page,

[FIGMA] [https://www.figma.com/file/T6hUVUDh5ihoYwQILcJDcf/React-Home-Test?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=lOTjaPb3chxGqXkY-1]

We love to see:
- Functional code
- Good design
- Unit testing


### Notes
All of you work should take place inside this repository.

You are free to use any packages that would help with this task

You do not need to add additional security measures as part of this exercise.
We're interested in how you break down the work and build your solution in a clean, easy-to-use, reusable and testable manner.


## Deliverables
You must follow the Figma design and need to add the functionality of:
a) Create new notes
c) Show all notes
b) Search notes

**Create a folder inside the repository and include finished screenshots of the app.**
**Please make sure to update the readme with**:

- How to run your app with all the necessary details
- Relating to the task please add answers to the following questions;
    1. How might you make this app more secure?
    2. How would you make this solution scale to millions of records?
